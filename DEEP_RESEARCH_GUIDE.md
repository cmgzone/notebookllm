# 🧠 Deep Research with Context Engineering - User Guide

## 🌟 Overview
The **Deep Research** feature has been enhanced with a powerful **Context Engineering Agent**. This agent doesn't just search the web; it analyzes the *context* of your research topic to provide a structured learning experience.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Context Engineering Agent
When enabled, the agent analyzes your research topic to generate:
- **Core Concepts**: Fundamental ideas you need to grasp.
- **Prerequisites**: What you should know before diving in.
- **Learning Path**: A step-by-step roadmap to mastery.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Mistakes to avoid.
- **Industry Standards**: Best practices in the field.
- **Mindmap**: A visual representation of the topic's structure (Mermaid.js).

### 2. Mindmap Generation
The agent automatically creates a visual mindmap of the research topic, helping you understand the relationships between different concepts at a glance.

### 3. Save to Notebook
You can now save the entire research report (including the mindmap and context analysis) directly to one of your notebooks. This turns your research into a permanent knowledge asset.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Navigate to Deep Research
1. Open the app sidebar or home screen.
2. Tap on **"Deep Research"**.

### Step 2: Configure Your Research
1. **Enter Query**: Type your research topic (e.g., "how to build a scalable backend").
2. **Enable Context Agent**: Toggle the switch **"Enable Context Engineering Agent"**.
   - This switch is located below the "Start Research" button
   - It has a brain circuit icon (🧠) next to it
   - *Tip: Keep this on for complex topics where you need a structured guide.*
3. **Select Notebook (Optional)**:
   - Tap the **"Save to Notebook"** dropdown.
   - Choose an existing notebook where you want to save the report.
   - *If you don't select a notebook, the report will be generated but not saved automatically.*

### Step 3: Start Research
1. Tap the **"Start Research"** button.
2. Watch as the agent:
   - 🧠 Analyzes the topic context.
   - 🔍 Generates sub-queries and searches the web.
   - 🖼️ Finds relevant images and videos.
   - 📝 Synthesizes a comprehensive report.

### Step 4: View and Use Results
- **Read the Report**: The report will include a special **"Context Engineering Analysis"** section with the learning path and mindmap.
- **View Mindmap**: Look for the mermaid diagram in the report.
- **Check Your Notebook**: If you selected a notebook, go to that notebook to find your new "Deep Research: [Topic]" source.

## 💡 Example Workflow

**Goal**: Learn about "Rust Programming".

1. Go to **Deep Research**.
2. Query: "Rust programming language for beginners".
3. Toggle **ON** "Enable Context Engineering Agent".
4. Select Notebook: "Programming Studies".
5. Click **Start Research**.

**Result**:
- A detailed report covering Rust syntax, memory safety, and concurrency.
- A **Learning Path**: Variables -> Ownership -> Borrowing -> Lifetimes.
- A **Mindmap** showing the ecosystem.
- The report is automatically saved to your "Programming Studies" notebook for future chat and reference.
