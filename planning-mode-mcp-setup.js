// Design notes
const designNotes = [
  {
    content: `## Database Schema Design

### Core Tables
- **plans**: Main plan storage with status tracking
- **plan_requirements**: EARS-formatted requirements
- **plan_design_notes**: Design documentation linked to requirements
- **plan_tasks**: Hierarchical task structure
- **task_status_history**: Audit trail for status changes
- **task_agent_outputs**: Agent-generated content
- **plan_agent_access**: Access control for agents

### Key Design Decisions
1. **UUID Primary Keys**: For distributed system compatibility
2. **JSONB for Arrays**: Flexible storage for acceptance criteria and metadata
3. **Cascading Deletes**: Maintain referential integrity
4. **Indexed Queries**: Optimized for common access patterns
5. **Timestamps**: Track creation, updates, and completion`,
    requirementIds: [0] // Links to first requirement
  },
  {
    content: `## Flutter UI Architecture

### Screen Hierarchy
- **PlansListScreen**: Overview of all plans with filters
- **PlanDetailScreen**: Tabbed interface (Requirements, Design, Tasks, Analytics)
- **PlanningAIScreen**: Chat interface for AI-assisted planning
- **TaskDetailSheet**: Bottom sheet for task management

### State Management
- **PlanningProvider**: Riverpod StateNotifier for plans state
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates via planning_provider
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with rollback on error

### Key Features
- Pull-to-refresh for plans list
- Search and filter capabilities
- Status badges and progress indicators
- Hierarchical task display with expand/collapse`,
    requirementIds: [0, 1, 2]
  },
  {
    content: `## MCP Integration Design

### Tool Categories
1. **Plan Management**: create_plan, get_plan, list_plans, update_plan_status
2. **Requirements**: create_requirement, list_requirements
3. **Design Notes**: create_design_note, list_design_notes
4. **Task Management**: create_task, update_task_status, complete_task
5. **Agent Outputs**: add_task_output
6. **Access Control**: grant_plan_access, revoke_plan_access

### Authentication
- Personal API tokens for agent authentication
- Token validation middleware
- Rate limiting per token

### WebSocket Protocol
- Connection: wss://api/planning/ws?token=xxx
- Message types: task_updated, plan_updated, requirement_added
- Heartbeat for connection health`,
    requirementIds: [4, 5, 6]

    content: `## EARS Pattern Implementation

### Pattern Templates
- **Ubiquitous**: THE <system> SHALL <response>
- **Event**: WHEN <trigger>, THE <system> SHALL <response>
- **State**: WHILE <condition>, THE <system> SHALL <response>
- **Unwanted**: IF <condition>, THEN THE <system> SHALL <response>
- **Optional**: WHERE <option>, THE <system> SHALL <response>
- **Complex**: Combination of above patterns

### Validation
- Pattern validation on requirement creation
- Template suggestions in UI
- Acceptance criteria as checklist

### Benefits
- Clear, testable requirements
- Consistent specification format
- Easy to understand for both humans and AI`,
    requirementIds: [3]

### Metrics Calculated
- **Completion Percentage**: (completed tasks / total tasks) * 100
- **Task Status Summary**: Count by status (not_started, in_progress, etc.)
- **Time Tracking**: Sum of time_spent_minutes across tasks
- **Completion Trend**: Historical data points for progress visualization

### Analytics Display
- Progress bar with percentage
- Pie chart for task status distribution
- Line chart for completion trend
- Time spent summary

### Performance Optimization
- Cached analytics calculations
- Incremental updates on task changes
- Efficient database queries with indexes`,
